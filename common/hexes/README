  @mainpage   libhexes

@section overview Overview:

  'libhexes' attempts to provide a object-oriented (C++) approach to 
developing with the ncurses library. 

  While initially, development was concerned with wrapping the ncurses 
and libpanel API within C++ objects for direct use in a C++ application, 
libhexes is still quite slim with very few 'widgets' having yet been 
created.


@section docs Documentation:
  The library API is available in html format generated via 'doxygen' 
(required for this operation).

Simply run 'make documentation' to generate the html docs.


@section build Build:

 Unix/Linux:
   Libhexes uses a custom build environment called 'tcamake' to control 
dependencies.  Running 'make' should suffice on supported platforms.
