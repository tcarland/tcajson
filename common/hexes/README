  @mainpage   libhexes

@section overview Overview:

  'libhexes' attempts to provide a simple, lightweight C++ object-oriented 
approach to developing with the ncurses library.  This was created initially to 
allow for easily adding curses support to existing c++ console applications. 
This includes an already mature event manager from libtcanet, however libhexes 
doesn't specifically depend on any given event management.

  While initially concerned with the running or wrapping of ncurses within a 
C++ application, libhexes is very slim in that not many additional 'widgets' 
have been created at this time.


@section docs Documentation:
  The library API is available in html format generated via 'doxygen' (required 
  for this operation).

Simply run 'make documentation' to generate the html docs.


@section build Build:

 Unix/Linux:
   Uses a custom build environment I call 'tcamake' to control dependencies. 
Running 'make' should suffice on supported platforms.
