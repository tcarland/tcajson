@section overview Overview:

  'libhexes' is a C++ library that attempts to provide an object-oriented 
approach to developing with the ncurses C library. 

  The initial library development was concerned primarily with wrapping 
the ncurses and panel API within convenient C++ objects for simplified 
use in cplusplus applications and very few 'widgets' having been created.
The framework is focusing on application interaction and specialization 
to simplify working with the terminal I/O where apps can easily design 
their own widgets. 

  At this time, there still needs to be much work put into underlying 
terminal I/O features and widgets for items like dropdown menus, radio boxes, 
etc.

   Hexes or 'libhexes' does rely and require both libncurses and the 
libpanel curses extension. 


@section docs Documentation:
  The library API is available in html format generated via 'doxygen' 
(required for this operation).

Simply run 'make documentation' to generate the html docs.


@section build Build:

 Unix/Linux:
   Libhexes uses a custom build environment called 'tcamake' to control 
dependencies.  Running 'make' should suffice on supported platforms.
