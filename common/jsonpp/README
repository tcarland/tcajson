@section overview Overview:

  The 'jsonpp' library is a C++ library implementation of the JSON 
standard, RFC 4627 (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt). JSON, or 
JavaScript Object Notation, is a text format for serializing 
structured data. More information about JSON can be found at 
www.json.org. 

  This implementation was created after browsing the currently 
available (at the time) C++ JSON implementations and either not 
liking the library, or not liking the licensing scheme for the 
given library or both. 


Notes:

 October 26, 2012 - version 0.1.

  In its current form, the library probably is not suited for 
heavy lifting in JSON, and is not yet fully compliant with the 
JSON specification. The following issues need to still be 
addressed:

  - proper Unicode support.
  - i/o stream support.
  - documentation.
