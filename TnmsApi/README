/**
  @mainpage  TnmsAPI

@section overview Overview:

  The primary API for Tnms Agents in C++ with language bindings for perl, 
python, and Java. The API provides a simple interface for acting as an agent
to a Tnms System. An agent is an application instance that can submit/send 
data to the Tnms System for reporting metrics.  The API makes use of the
TnmsCore API which further defines the Tnms system and is generally linked 
into this API to provide a single library with all neccessary objects.

  If an application wishes to be a client as well as an Agent, then some use 
of the tnmsCore library would be needed. 

@section docs Documentation:
  The library is being documented in an API format via doxygen. 
Run 'make documentation' to generate the docs (doxygen req.)

@section build Build:

*nix:
  Uses tcamake build environment to set dependencies for simply running
'make'. The library links only libpthread and libdl (+libsocket and libnsl
with 'SunOS_sun4u'). 

Win32/64:
  Visual studio project files should be provided for win32 support
(only the thread classes are iffy with windows and are not compiled 
under win32 (the win32 pthread library may be compatible, but ymmv)
