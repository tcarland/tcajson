'tcamake' is a build environment for code projects using GNU make. 
It is not its own make system, but instead trys to provide a clean and 
simple method of managing a large project dependencies. 
I have used this system reliably for years and serves as my excuse to 
avoid the GNU autoconf toolset.

The build environment is specific to a directory structure starting with 
a root directory that is referred to as $TOPDIR. This can be for a 
specific project or group of projects as needed.  The term project is 
used loosely to define the encompassing environment that may, in fact, 
contain many projects. The 'tcamake' build environment should exist in
'$TOPDIR/tcamake'. 

Each Makefile beneath the top-level defines the TOPDIR variable to point 
to the relative root of the project/environment tree.
Additionally, each Makefile 'includes' $TOPDIR/tcamake/buildenv.

The Files:

  projectdefs 
        - This should be included once by a top-level Makefile.
  build    
        - This is included by sub-level Makefiles and pulls in the 
        needed dependencies.
  depends
        - Defines all of our project dependencies
  autodepend
        - defines our dependency and build commands, included by depends.
