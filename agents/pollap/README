  Pollap: Snmp Poller Project
  ---------------------------


 Performance analysis of an snmp poller. 

   ( (num_devices * queries/dev) * intervals/min ) * pdu_size 
                          /
                  60 secs = bytes/sec ??

   
  Multi-staged project for providing three key aspects of an snmp poller.

  1.  A well-defined configuration (xml) for creating a heirarchy of 
  query relationships. Specifically, the ability to use an snmp object id
  as the 'key' to subsequent and related snmp queries (ie. sub-queries).
  The configuration heirarchy and device mapping to related queries would 
  be abstracted in a fashion to permit a highly scaleable poller design.
  
  2. A fast and efficient snmp poller.

    Simple, serial style polling in a threaded environment.
    Potential snmp wrapper for utilizing any given number of underlying 
    snmp libraries for performance comparison.

  3. Abstract Data collection entailing a modular approach to resulting 
  data output. eg. sql, rrd, other.
